# Ping-Traceroute

### Usage
- To use ping.py, enter ``ping.py <hostname> <number of pings>`` from the command line. The third argument is optional, and if
none is supplied then the program will simply ping indefinitely until a keyboard interrupt. In both cases,
statistics are printed at the end. 
  
- To use traceroute.py, do  ``traceroute.py <hostname>``, and the program will run a traceroute of the
hostname. Note that we ran and tested the project in Windows 10, and used anaconda.
